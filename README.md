### React Table

React Table is a lightweight, flexible, and customizable table library for React that allows us to easily create complex tables with sorting, filtering, pagination, and other advanced features. It provides a set of reusable components and hooks that can be use to manage the state of their table, including things like sorting and filtering.

The learning objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use the React Table library and its various hooks to create a paginated, sortable, and filterable table with global filtering capabilities. The project also shows how to implement pagination with navigation buttons, page size dropdown, and page count information. Additionally, the project showcases the use of useMemo hook to improve performance by memoizing data and columns. Overall, this project is an example of how to create a dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly table component in React.
